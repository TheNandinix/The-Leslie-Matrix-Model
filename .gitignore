--- Python Internals ---

Ignore temporary files created by Python to speed up execution

pycache/
*.py[cod]

Ignore environment folders if you create them

venv/
env/
.env

--- Operating System Files ---

Ignore annoying system files created by Mac/Windows

.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

output/plots/*

This ensures the 'output/plots' folder exists in the repo

even if it is initially empty.

!output/plots/.gitkeep
